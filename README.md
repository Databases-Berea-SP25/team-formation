# Team Formation
**Learning Objective:** Setup your teams, decide roles, and practice Git while you're at it

## Git Practice 

Each team member should clone a copy of this document onto their own computer. Then, in turns, edit the document to record your team's discussion, commit and push the changes. Everyone then should `git pull` the changes made. By the end of this assignment, EACH team member should have edited, committed, and pushed changes at least once. For this assignment, you can do this all on the main branch. You should use the Command-Line (terminal) to get practice with this process. We will be using it extensively all semester.

### FAQ

- [I don't remember how to use Git.](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

- Do I need to use codespaces? No, you can clone this repo to your computer, and use VS Code on your machine to view and edit this markdown (readme.md) file.
- Can't I just use the GUI on VS Code for the Github stuff? No.

## CHOOSING TEAM ROLES 

 As part of an agile software team, each member takes on well-defined roles that have important responsibilities that they carry out on the team’s behalf. Good delegation of responsibility ensures that the work gets done well, and in a timely and efficient manner. 

**PRE-READ**: Before moving on, read this brief article describing the stages of team formation: **["Using the Stages of Team Development"](https://hr.mit.edu/learning-topics/teams/articles/stages-development)**

This project milestone is part of the "Forming" stage.

**TEAM NAME: <enter here>**
- <MemberName 1>

- <MemberName 3>
- <MemberName 4>

## Part 1: DISCUSS

Each member should discuss what each of you can bring to the table, strengths and growth areas. Ensure everyone has a chance to share and ask followup questions as needed. 

| Member  | Strengths to Contribute | Growth Areas |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Member A  | strength1, strength2...  | improve1, improve2  |
| Member B  | strength1, strength2...  | improve1, improve2  |
| Member C  | strength1, strength2...  | improve1, improve2  |
| Member D  | strength1, strength2...  | improve1, improve2  |


## Part 2: DELEGATE

As a team, discuss each project role outlined in the document below. 

* Please review this document with a general description of role-based team work: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JK5JF5Fb7m-cYFKTx9pMgGiZWxG_vQxtZr94EwP5334/edit#heading=h.j7ffj34l9uxj](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JK5JF5Fb7m-cYFKTx9pMgGiZWxG_vQxtZr94EwP5334/edit#heading=h.j7ffj34l9uxj)
* Adapt the responsibilities in the above document to the context of this database project and your project team. Write out the full description for each role below (we’ve got you started below). 
* This is your chance to clearly articulate your expectations _of each other_ before starting the project. The expectations in this document will form the basis for your peer review rubrics. 
* After you have completed these descriptions, discuss how you want to assign roles in your teams. Consider each other’s strengths, prior experience, and desired growth areas. 

Please note, a member’s role indicates they are responsible for making sure a particular aspect of the project is done. It does NOT mean they should be the one doing all the work in that category! 

The exception to this is the Communications Manager, who will be the main point of contact between the client and the team. However, the entire team should be involved in crafting the communications, include drafts and proofreading.

## Part 3: COMMUNICATE

Your first order of business is to craft a professional email to your client partner to introduce yourselves as a project team. Think of this as a consultant team introducing themselves to a newly contracted client. In addition to your names and roles,  what do you want your client to know about your team? What are you called? What can they expect from you in your working relationship?

In addition to your formal introductions, invite your client to a meeting with you to further discuss the organizations goals, data, and project possibilities. Provide at least 3 different meeting options. All team members should be present during this meeting. Please be as flexible as possible when finding a potential meeting time, as our clients are often doing this on top of their regular work, family, and organizational duties.  

The Communications Manager should send all emails to the client, and other team members should help craft the content of the email, proofread for grammar and spelling, and agree on the introduction before sending it. All team members should always be cc'd on _all_ emails and replies.

If you are unsure whether your email would be considered professional, we encourage you to send a draft to your instructors for review and feedback before sending. This is a learning process!


## **Submission**: 

* Commit and push this completed document, including agreed upon role assignments. All members should edit, commit, and push something.
* The email to your client should be sent no later than 12pm on Tuesday, 1/30.
* A copy of the email should be submitted to this repository as a text document (.txt) or markdown (.md)
